# Code Review: Autodocument MCP Server

## Overview

This codebase implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for automatic documentation and code analysis tools. The system uses OpenRouter API to generate documentation, test plans, and code reviews for code repositories. The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns across multiple components.

## Key Components

### Configuration System (`config.ts`)

The configuration system provides a flexible way to configure the autodocument server:

- Defines the `AutodocumentConfig` interface with settings for OpenRouter API, file processing, and documentation output
- Provides default configuration values with sensible defaults
- Implements a `getConfig` function that merges defaults with environment variables and explicit overrides

### Server Implementation (`index.ts`)

The main server implementation:

- Creates an MCP server that handles tool requests
- Implements handlers for listing available tools and executing tool calls
- Manages error handling and progress reporting
- Uses a tool registry to access different auto-* tools

### Prompt Configuration (`prompt-config.ts`)

Centralizes all prompts used by the different auto-* tools:

- Provides specialized prompts for documentation generation
- Includes prompts for test plan generation
- Contains prompts for code review generation
- Each tool has variants for regular directories, top-level directories, and directories with children

### File Analysis (`analyzer/index.ts`)

The `FileAnalyzer` class handles analyzing code files:

- Determines which files should be included in analysis based on extension and size
- Enforces limits on file size and count to prevent overloading the LLM
- Creates content for undocumented directories
- Includes logic to determine if a directory should be documented

### OpenRouter Client (`openrouter/client.ts`)

The `OpenRouterClient` class manages communication with the OpenRouter API:

- Handles API authentication and request formatting
- Provides methods to generate content with custom prompts
- Supports updating existing content
- Handles errors from the API gracefully

## Integration Points

The system is well-integrated with:

1. The `ToolRegistry` and `ToolAggregator` components that manage available tools and their execution
2. The MCP server SDK for handling requests and responses
3. The OpenRouter API for generating content

## Strengths

- Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive configuration system with sensible defaults
- Flexible prompt system that can be customized without code changes
- Good error handling and progress reporting
- Support for different types of auto-* tools (documentation, test plans, code reviews)

## Improvement Opportunities

1. **Security Considerations**: 
   - The API key is passed through environment variables and constructor parameters, which is good, but there's no validation of user-provided paths to prevent path traversal attacks

2. **Error Handling**:
   - While there is error handling in place, some error messages could be more specific to help with debugging

3. **Code Organization**:
   - The `AutodocumentServer` class in `index.ts` is handling multiple responsibilities and could potentially be split into smaller classes

4. **Documentation**:
   - The code has good comments, but could benefit from more examples of how to use the different components

Overall, the codebase is well-designed with a clear architecture and good separation of concerns. The prompt configuration system is particularly well-designed, allowing for easy customization of the generated content.
